# graph-examples

This repo contains a collection of graph examples.  The intent is to give some more complete and extensive examples than what is reasonable to include in docs or blog posts.  This will variously include loader scripts, schemas, example traversals, things to try in Studio, and code examples.  Feel free to use and modify any of these for your own purposes.  There is no warranty or implied official support but hopefully they can be useful as a starting point to show various ways of loading and experimenting with graph data.  And if you see anything that could be improved or added, issue reports and pull requests are always welcome!
