KillrVideo DSL
==============

This is a starter project that shows how to build a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for
link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/[Apache TinkerPop's] Gremlin graph traversal language.
link:http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#dsl[Gremlin DSLs] provide a way to extend the graph language
with new steps that can help reduce complexity of Gremlin code.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Python 2.7+
* A running instance of link:https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise-graph[DSE Graph]
** Load the `graph-examples/killrvideo` data as specified in the link:https://github.com/datastax/graph-examples/blob/master/killrvideo/README.md[README]

Building and Running
--------------------

[source,text]
mvn clean install

Executing
---------

There is a small application that runs serveral traversals using the defined DSL and outputs the results to the
console. It can be executed through Maven with:

[source,text]
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.killrvideo.KillrVideoApp"
